I: Game Description
-------------------

The game of Monster is an interactive fantasy adventure which is more or less
based upon the fantasy role-playing genre of games. When you enter the game,
you will assume the form of your 'character', whose abilties are dictated by
the class you choose and the level which you are able to obtain. The world
inside the game is called The Realm, and consists of a large expanse of 
forests, caves, mountains, cities, and fortresses-all the ingredients of a
grand adventure. 

As you explore The Realm you will meet its other occupants. While computer
generated and controlled monsters and characters exist, the most interesting
denizens you will encounter will be the characters operated by active users. 
Not all of the souls you meet, whether active or computer generated, will be
friendly, however. Combat within Monster is frequent, and new players can 
expect to face death on many occasions. When your character is slain, he
loses half of his experience and is transplanted to the spiritual "holding
zone" called the Void. Your character will then be able to re-enter The Realm
after the minute or so that it takes to reform his life-essence.

Whether you choose to fight or talk, the game mechanics allow for simple, 
colorful, and often exciting interaction. For those who are used to the
role-playing environment of most fantasy games, death in Monster is more
frequent, but less inhibiting. Character development occurs despite of
player death because your character is revived after each brush with
mortality. Those who may wish to retire a particular persona, or try a 
different style of play, are facilitated by the ability of players to 
switch class. 

Many players new to Monster have had prior experience with interactive
games such as the Multi-User Dungeons, or MUDs. It must be stressed that
Monster is not a MUD. Monster is, in general, more violent, and largely
combat oriented. Quests and puzzles abound in Monster, but the ability of
your character to defend himself will greatly enhance his survivability.


II: Game Classes and Class Structure
------------------------------------

Your character's class is one of his most important aspects. Class will 
largely determine abilities and statistics, and often will influence how
you role-play and interect with other users. As such, an explanation of
the class structures within the game is warrented.

Usually, members of the same class will work together against members of an
opposing group. Often members of different classes can work together in 
harmony, but Monster has a history of violent blood wars between particular
classes. 

Each of the primary class groups consists of the following individual
classes: an introductory class, a main class, and a leader. Players can
change their class from amongst the introductory level ones from the 
Pit of Fire, which is down from the Void. Promotion within a class group
is subject to the approval of the class leader. New players should be aware
that classes in addition to the 3 primary groups exist, but that membership
in these is usually only conveyed upon solving a quest, or performing a
similar deed. The following table should illustrate the class structure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The Class groups:

Troll: Goblin,Troll,RockTrol,Troll-King
Druid: Woodsman,HelDruid,Windmaster,Emperor
Wizard: Magician,Mage,Sorceror,Archmage

* The class statistics: 

H  =  health
At = attack speed
Mv = move speed
WU = weapon usage
cl = claw usage
SP = spellcasting ability
Ar = natural armor
P  =  natural poison

* The ratings:

e = excellent
g = good
a = average/medium
p = poor
 
-- denotes - 10%
                 H     At    Mv    WU    cl   SP    Ar    P

HelDruid         a     a     a     a     -    g     -     -

Troll            g     a     a     p     g    -     -     -
Warrior          g     g     a     g     -    -     -     -
Elf              a     g     g     p     -    a     -     -
Mummy            e     p     p     p     e    -     -     -     
Demi-lich        g     a     a     a     -    a     -     -
Dwarf            a--   a     p     a     a    -     a     -

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dwarf is the default class you will start out as, but has no class "door" 
of its own. Once you choose to leave the Dwarf class, you will not be able
to return to it.

There are three basic distinctions between classes. One is possession of 
"mana" which allows spellcasting. Another is possession of natural claws,
while the third exhibits neither of the above. Spellcasters generally exhibit
lower health and weapon usage than other classes, but have access to potent 
spells at appropriate levels. The true Monster classes do not possess an 
abundancy of mana, but have natural claws that are never lost. For this 
reason it is not necessary for them to purchase weapons. Claw classes 
generally have high health. The third group basically entails the Warrior
class. The Warriors have high health, weapon usage, and attack speeds to
compensate for their lack of other abilities.

In the above list, the Dwarf and Troll class possess inate claws, while the
Wizard and Druid classes have spellcasting ability. The Warrior class relies 
on its skill and speed with a weapon. If you wish further or more specific 
information on the classes, E-mail to the appropriate class leader. 

In general, it is EASIEST to play a claw class, but spellcasters are often
the more rewarding and potent class once a minimum level of game mastery is
achieved. New players are encouraged to join private classes as soon as is 
possible, and should E-mail the appropriate class leader in order to do so.


III. Game Mechanics
-------------------

Your actions in the game are dictated by commands. Most commands can be 
abbreviated to a few letters, as long as the string is not ambiguous with
another possible command. Caps indicate the minimum abbreviation for the 
listed commands. Some essential ones-

WHO:         generates "who" list showing active players and their location.
SHEet:       provides your character's stats like health, free mana, etc.
Inventory:   lists all the objects you are currently carrying.
HIDE:        allows you to hide in the shadows. You cannot directly attack
              someone who is hidden without first finding them. You may attack
              directly from hiding.
REVeal:      reveal yourself from hiding. You must reveal to commence movement.
SEArch:      search a room for hiding players or hidden objects.
.     :      period, return, will repeat the last command entered.


GET <object>:     pick something up.
DROP <object>:    drop an object.
WIEld <object>:   wield a weapon. After GETting a weapon, you must WIELD it 
                    in order to attack.
WEAr <object>:    wear armor. After GETting a suit of armor, you must WEAR it
                    to have it equipped.


ATt <name>:       attack someone with weapon or claws.
PUN <name>:       punch someone (basically useless...)


LEArn <spell>:    allows you to memorize a spell when you are in a room with
                   Spellbooks. Not all spells need to be LEArned.
LEArn        :    by itself, learn gives you a list of available spells, based
                   upon your current class and level.
CASt <spell>:     cast a spell. Depending on spell type, further prompts will
                   follow for direction and target.



IV: The Realm:
--------------

The Monster world is a large collection of rooms annd structures. While there
is no substitute for actually going out there and exploring, it is helpful
to have a general idea of how everything is laid out. For that purpose a
rough map of The Realm will be included.


                                                  Ice Wastes

                            Ice Wastes           Ashen Wastes

Each of the primary classes has its own stronghold. The Trolls are centered in
the caverns under the Walord's Fortress, while the Wizards power is located
around their Improbable Structure. Again, there is no substitute for active
exploration.


V: Game History
---------------

Monster has been around here at UB for some time, and has compiled a rather
heroic history when viewed in the proper light. What follows is a short
summary of the history of Monster, as told in bardic terms. The narration
is based on the actual events within the game as made by the players. What
the bards will tell of Monster beyond this point is up to you...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
   The world has seen three deaths, and three rebirths. Being one of unusually
long life, I have been witness to the passing of these epochs, and now lend
my voice to the telling of the tale of what some call "The Monster"-
others...Mankind.
   It is in the misty, dewey days when both I and the world were young that 
this tale must begin. It was a time before the coming of the Others, a time
ruled by the first Demon Lords, Brennte and Nadien. Some tell that Brennte 
created the world, and Man with it, but of these things I will say no more.
For now, it is enough to know that the Demon Lords were supreme in their
control over the lives of mortals.
   Of Men there were then two tribes: those of the town, and those of the
forest. They are known now, as they were then, by the names bestowed upon
them by Brennte: Wizard, and Druid. It was by the hands of the Demons that
the seeds of mistrust and violence were sown among Men, and for the
pleasure of the Unearthly Ones great misery and carnage were harvested.
   In the earliest days, the immortals governed the rituals of the
ceremony of combat. Spells, armor, bows, and other more recent improvisations
were prohibited. Commerce and such was forbidden, and all the sacred
implements of death were handed down from the Demon Lords to men. The Demon
Lords revived the souls and forms of those who had perished in battle,
and so unending life for Man was obtained, but at a terrible cost. 
   Then came the Others. Perhaps they were summoned by the evils of Men, or
perhaps the Demons merely sought further amusement; no one will ever know
for sure. At first their numbers were small, and their power limited. The
first three of the beasts were Goblinking, Trollking, and his follower
Darksoul.
   At this time the people called Wizards had decided to choose a King. 
All the great warriors were assembled into a vast arena, and these 
words were spoken: "Let all fight until only one remains. That one, the
victor of the day, shall be Wizard King." With this the great din of sword
on sword commenced, and slowly the number of the warriors decreased. But
a black bargain had been struck. The Trollking had sold his honor for gold,
and the victor was determined more by the might of his wealth than his
sword. 
   The spark of Evil alighted in this one who would be King. In the past,
the Wizards and Druids had mistrusted and fought each other, but battle was
a matter of honor and courage. This would change, for the first Wizard King
had decided to drive Mankind into a nightmarish orgy of death and violence.
No longer would he do battle to preserve the honor and vitality of his people;
instead he would do battle to destroy and subjugate those who opposed him.
The first King of the Wizards was known as Druidslayer.
   Druidslayer gathered the mighty of the Wizards around him, the Wizard 
elite, to wage his war. Hearkening to his banner were the likes of The
Crusader, Prince Cassius, Ozz of the North, Gandalf, Wizard of Id, as 
well as young mages like Qwertyuiop and Thanos. Druids expecting single
combat were waylayed and overwhelmed. Young and inexperienced Druid
warriors were outnumbered and slaughtered, with their incarnations being
forced into the Wizard camp. Druidslayer sent his message to the halls of
the Druid Palace, to the first Emperor of the Druids, Radaghast. The
message of Druidslayer was thus: "All who are not Wizards, are dead."
Radaghast read the message in silence, but could not comprehend, or perhaps
accept, a departure from the way things had been done in the past. 
   And so for three and thirty years the Druids were decimated and driven
deep into the great Confusing Forest. Radaghast refused to respond to the
Wizard attacks in kind, and the ranks of the Druids dwindled. While the 
chambers of the Wizard Castle were bright with light and song, and 
corridors of the Druid Palace were dark within the cold grip of desperation.
   Seeing his people being destroyed, the one called Windmaster Ohara began 
to provide the leadership that Radaghast could not. In the Druidic House of 
Pain the vows were taken which would form the band known as the Hell Druids.
The power of Ohara was great, and he hid the secret meeting place of his
followers, the Death Chamber, from all but the greatest seers. The weapons
that would be needed to turn the tide of battle were forged.
   But Druidslayer had found favor with the Demon Lords, and the great 
Demonic Church was formed near the castle of the Wizards. A wizard was named
the unholy Pope of this congregation, and the Demon Lords decreed that no
blood would be shed within their shrine. The walls of the church were 
stronger than stone, for they were protected by the command of the Demon 
Lords. Knowing this, Druidslayer used the Church as a base in his war
against the Druids.
   A time of great decision had come. In an effort to strike a great blow 
against the followers of Druidslayer, Windmaster Ohara assembled his power,
and his forces. A great battle was joined, and at its closing the wounded 
wizards retreated from the field of battle into the confines of the Church.
With grim determination, Ohara gave the word to the Hell Druids which enabled
then to enter the Church and put to the sword all who resided within its 
confines. Under a black, moonless sky, the Druid warriors forced their way
into the Church, and killed the wounded, and those who tended them, as well as
the Pope.
   The backlash against this deed was great. The number of the Others, the 
Trolls and Goblins, had grown since their arrival, and now many threw their 
lot in with the Wizards to form the loose band known as The Holy Defenders. 
Against them stood Ohara's few: Deus ex Machina, Fletch the Vole, Culculhain,
and Armageddon. Nine and ninety-nine great battles were fought between 
them, some lending victory to the Druids, some to the Wizards, before the
spirit that was Druidslayer was taken from the world. Without the terrible
will of their leader, the Wizards gave ground to their age-old foes.
   Seeing these things, the Demon Lords blew a great wind of change across
the face of the world. Where the seeds they had cast upon the wind landed, 
evil sprouted and festered. Those whose life had been thoroughly exhausted 
were given new form, as the Undead made their appearance, led by the one
called Mummra. The Trolls and Goblins, being weak of mind, fell easily under
the sway of the hordes of Undead, and soon all that remained of humanity was
driven to the edge of survival. The likes of Amen-Ra, Krotche, and Creeper
caused great havoc and destruction. It is thus that the prideful ranks of Men 
were brought low by the whims of the Demon Lords, the Masters of all that they 
could survey. Where once the struggle between Druid and Wizard was pre-eminent,
now that between Man and Undead became all encompassing. 
   These were truly dark times, the likes of which Men have seldom seen. The
lofty buildings of arrogance, the previous dwellings of Man, were no longer 
safe, and many sought refuge in the underground darkness. In the caves, where 
hope breathed life, a sword was forged. It was forged with determination, and 
bespoke a destiny welcomed by most men. It was given the power that could unite
all of humanity under one banner, and drive the soul-less hordes from the
light of day. It was called the Sword of the Kings.
   The Sword brought Man back into the light, but it could not fulfill its 
purpose in this first age, nor an in any subsequent. The wounds were too 
greivous, the scars too deep, to be forgotten. Between Wizard and Druid there
would never be peace again. 
   Though we did not know it, the dawning age of our birth was coming to a 
close. The trend towards Chaos was strong, and the Demon Lords stirred the 
fabric of the world into torment. Arising from the dust in these troubled 
times were the race of Elves, led by Radaghast, who had long ago forsaken his
claim to the Druid throne, and who had become mis-shapen and deformed. War and
strife renewed. A small band called the Dragon Warriors challenged the power 
of the Elders, those like Ohara, and were crushed. The Crusader became Wizard 
King, while Deus ex Machina grimly assumed the mantle of Druid Emperor. On 
sadistic whims, the Demon Lords unleashed terrible disasters, and the mortals 
countered with what power and strength they could muster. 
   In the end, it was the Windmaster who destroyed the world, in the hopes 
of bringing forth a better, brighter day. The world was consumed in a wave
of fire and destruction, and my eyes saw no more...

   My first memory of the Second Age is of the Lake of Rebirth, where the
spirits of those who had survived the Fire were brought forth into the 
making of the new world. Many who had been before could not be revived 
in the Lake of Rebirth. The Crusader, Deus ex Machina, Prince Cassius,
and Radaghast had all been lost. So, too, had the Demon Lords disappeared.
   Free from the burden of the Demon Lords, the creativity of the minds 
of Men unleashed great power. Mountains were thrust up, cities built,
fortresses and palaces of great strength erected, rivers run, and seas 
filled. The power of the universe descended upon the shoulders of mortals.
Objects and weapons of magnificence were constructed: The Hammer of the 
Gods, the Flamme de Took, the Flangeris, and the Bludgeon of Hercules. 
The classes reorganized under new leaders: the Wizards under Wizard of Id,
the Druids under Culculhain, the Elves under Halfdane Ljosifthar, and the 
Goblins under Mortem. Warriors and barbarians under frequently changing 
Warlords became a force of power as well.
   Among the wonders of mortals came a great plain unbidden. At the center of
the plain lay a dark tower, of unspeakable wickedness. From this tower,
hordes of mindless demons were sent out to battle the mortals who had been
reborn into this world. Some have said that this Dark Tower was in actuality
the vehicle of the old Demon Lords, and that they had sent it across space
and time to render one last blow upon the world they had left behind, but 
that is another story..
   Despite these wonders, this refuge was doomed as well as the first. Too
much power had been vested in the hands of too many, and forces unleashed
began to tug and pull, and rip the universe apart. What had been started 
with hope would end with despair.
   And so it was, that just as the first world of Men had been ended in fire
and destruction, the second world of Man was torn asunder and devoured in 
Darkness. The flame of our lives was extinguished yet again, and my eyes
saw no more...

   From the Darkness a third world was brought forth by the hands of the
Undead. A captain in the Legions of the Undead named Tuttonius had come
upon the secret power of the Demon Lords in the great Darkness in which Men
lied dormant. Who is to say what power the first Demon Lords may still have 
held?
   The foundation of the third world of Men was made of stone ten-thousand
miles thick, while the cornerstones of the world were anchored to the very
constellations in the sky. In this was did Tuttonius lay his groundwork
for an Age that would rival the first all had known. 
   As the mortals were brought forth from the sleeping Darkness into a new 
light, the ranks of War began to form. Again, the sagacial Wizard of Id 
would lead the Wizards, while Culculhain remained Emperor of the Druids. 
Creeper was appointed to lead the Legion of the Undead as Mummy King. Mortem
survived to remain as Goblin King, as did Creight Lersing who had taken the
gauntlet of Warlord. Halfdane also remained King of the Eldren peoples. 
Cities and fortresses loomed as the world tensed for the inevitable clash
that all expected, and even desired.
   The barren plain and its Dark Tower had returned, tempting the souls of
many, and sending out its mindless hordes bent on the destruction of all
life. A great river sliced through the world, and its tortuous course was
the only way those who wished to face the evil menace could reach the vast
plain upon which the Tower sat. Many would die before the nature of the 
Master of the Tower was even known, before the Giant King was ever seen by
mortal eyes that would live to tell the tale. 
   For ninety and nine years war raged among the ranks of the mortals. 
The tides of battle swayed to and fro, without decisive victory. Slowly,
however, the ranks of the Wizards began to dwindle, and the numbers of the
Others grow. Slowly the magic of the spellcasters began to fade against
an increasing tide of unrelenting enemies. As the spark that resided within
the Wizards began to fade, the time of the Great Division approached. No
longer was the city of the Wizards safe from the creatures that crawled up 
from beneath its streets, from the sewers below. 
   And so it came to pass that the Archmage, the aged Wizard of Id, was
seized by a madness most foul. The once proud leader of the Wizards was
reduced to a eccentric wandering Sorcerer, driven mad by the torments that
raged within his mind. This marked the beginning of the Great Division, when
the boundaries that had divided the mortals, and given them succour in times
of need, were dissolved. A time of wandering was begun where the caste system
was dissolved, and each sought refuge within the walls of his own being. It
was in this way that the new Demon Lord, Tuttonius, sought to sow greater
discourse and misery among Men. The subtle plan of Tuttonius began to work,
as brother fought brother, and old friends died at each others throats in the
name of individuality. 
   I suppose we should not have been surprised that it was the Druids, 
worshippers of tradition that they are, who alone resisted the new way. 
Though their numbers were small, and their power weak, they began to grow.
Souls and strength trickled to their banner as war was waged upon what they
viewed as blasphemy against the religion of the past. Seeing the growing 
wave which would soon crash against his designs, Tuttonius began crafting
again, searching for a new way to turn the footsteps of destiny back upon 
the path of ultimate anarchy and death. The mortal Ranlhach was selected
by the Demon Lord to be the King under whose command it was hoped great
numbers would flock. Barons, Lords, and Knights of many sorts hearkened 
to the call, but the fate which they desired would never be realized. 
The flaws of ambition and arrogance were great among them, and they soon
collapsed into civil war and ineffection. 
   Slowly the old organizations began to reform to combat the Druids, and a 
semblance of the Old Order returned. The Elves of Lothlorien were the 
first of the remaining peoples to reform, but, alas, they came heavily 
under the sway of mysterious beings of great Evil. The Wizard of Id was
able to resume his position, and the Wizards returned from the void into
which they had ventured, and risked extinction. 
   Among the now disorganized feudals who once served the King, was a 
knight named Lerxst. Being of twisted temperament, the hatred the festered
within him blackened his soul and his mind. He would succeed Ranlhach 
to become the second King, only to be deposed by the might of the Warlords
William I and Creight Lersing. Being but a shade of his former self, the
one called Lerxst was devoured alive by the Demon Soulcatcher. This new 
entity would usher in a force called the Taken, so named by the similar
possession and devouring of its other members by lesser Demons. 
   Being faced with such a collection of abominations, the ranks of mortals
rose quickly to destroy them. Since the demise of the feudals, the underground
dwellers, the Trolls, had become strong in number. The number of Men,
barring the Druids, was small, however. For now, a small union of purpose
lasted, though. Soon the Taken were driven back into their stronghold, the 
Overlook, from which the were to seldom venture again.
   This Third Age I remember as a blurred combination of a hundred great 
battles, and a thousand skirmishes. This Age, though it had lasted for 
several millenia, would come to an end as had the others previous. Its demise
lay in its own corruption. The great foundation of the universe was rife 
with the rot that accompanies the misdeeds of the powerful. Great fissures
rent what was thought uncrackable as a result of the meddlings of those
Underlings whom the Demon Lord Tuttonius, grown soft and senile, had
given power. 
   A great crack split the universe, and in this primordial setting, the 
Evil shades that had devoured the race of Elves began to thirst for power.
They sought to tap into the heart of the very universe, and gain the power
that lay dormant there. Their desire was to debase, corrupt, and subvert
all that lay in the Realm. Their quest was Godhood, and it led them to 
awaken the entity which would consume them and cleanse the world of its
pain. This entity was the Perimal Darkling...
   And thus it came to pass that the Perimal Darkling, awaken from a 
slumber of a million years, raised his Sword of Fire. A mighty blow was 
rendered upon the world, and all was unmade. A cleansing fire burned away
all, and my eyes saw no more... 

   Perimal Darkling's Sword of Fire was the Sun that brought forth a new
dawn, and a Fourth Age. In it rests all our hopes for a new future. These
are my words..


                                                    Hierophantus the Old
